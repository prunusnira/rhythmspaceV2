This is a demo version of  MPMP (multi platform media player). (version  1.8.5)
It has the same capabilities as the official version from the Assetstore but draws a watermark on top of the videos.
(The VLC Watermark is a red image that flickers every 20 sec)
You can work with this version when you develop and can exchange the plugins folder with all the native components later.
(Experimental WebGL support comes only with the paid version)

For further information please read the manual.



If you have any questions, suggestions or found a bug you can reach me at info@monoflow.org

Thanks for your interest!
